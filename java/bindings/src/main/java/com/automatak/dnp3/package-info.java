/**
 * A package for all of the interfaces and pure java classes
 * used in the opendnp3 java bindings.
 *
 * The root interface is DNP3Manager and is the starting point of
 * all applications.
 *
 * You need the opendnp3-bindings jar with the package com.automatak.dnp3.impl
 * package to obtain a concrete reference to a DNP3Manager, i.e. :
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * DNP3Manager manager = DNP3ManagerFactory.createManager(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
 * }
 * </pre>
