Overview
========

OpenDNP3 is a portable, scalable, and rigorously tested implementation 
of the DNP3 (www.dnp.org) protocol stack written in C++.  The library 
is optimized for massively parallel front end  processor implementations
and slave device simulations, although it performs very well on 
embedded linux ARM  architectures.


Organization
============

The repository is organized by language:

  cpp		core C++ opendnp3 library
	
  java		jni bindings for Java

  clr		Microsoft CLR wrappers

Building and Installing
=======================

The OpenDNP3 library has been verified under linux, cygwin, and windows.
Three build systems are included:
  
  1. GNU autotools
  2. Visual Studio 2012 SLN and PROJ files

## GNU autotools ##

The GNU autotools are comprised of two packages, GNU autoconf and GNU
automake.  Libtool support is required.  Lcov support may be
required if you choose to build those options.

Requirements:

  - boost v1.52 or later            (required) 
    * boost::system                 (required) 
    * Boost Unit Test Framework     (required)
  - docbook v0.6.14 or later        (required if 'make docs')
  - lcov                            (required if 'make lcov')
  - libtool                         (required)
  - Java JDK with JNI support       (required if 'configure --with-java=javac')

To start, first reinitialize autotools to be compatible with the version
running on your system:

  autoreconf -f -i

Next, run the 'configure' script:

  ./configure

A full list of options can be found using './configure --help'.

You can now build the OpenDNP3 libraries and programs:

  make

When ready, you can install the libraries, headers, and programs onto
your system:

  make install

If you want to build the doxygen code documentation, use the following
make target after configuring the system:

  make doxygen-doc

The resulting HTML documentation will be placed in a folder named
'doxygen-doc'.

If you want to build the libraries with lcov support (analysis tool for
code coverage of the unit/integration test infrastructure), the process
changes slightly:

  autoreconf -f -i
  ./configure --enable-lcov
  make
  ./dnp3test
  make lcov

The lcov HTML report is written to './lcov/html/index.html' and can be
opened with any standard web browser.

If you will be making changes to the unit/integration test
infrastructure while analyzing the lcov results, use an alternate
sequence to reduce the amount of rebuilding required:

  autoreconf -f -i
  ./configure --enable-lcov
  make
  ./dnp3test
  make lcov

  Iterate on the following sequence after changing the tests:

     make lcov-reset        ; # Reset lcov data between each run
     make                   ; # Rebuild with the new changes
     ./dnp3test             ; # Profile the new changes
     make lcov-report       ; # Regenerate the lcov report
