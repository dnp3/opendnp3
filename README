Overview
========

OpenDNP3 is a portable, scalable, and rigorously tested implementation 
of the DNP3 (www.dnp.org) protocol stack written in C++. The library 
is optimized for the largest front end processor implementations
and slave device simulations, although it performs very well on 
embedded linux ARM in a single outstation configuration.

Custom written, idiomatic bindings are available for the 
Microsoft CLR family of languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, etc) and JVM-based
languages (Java, Scala, Clojure, etc).
