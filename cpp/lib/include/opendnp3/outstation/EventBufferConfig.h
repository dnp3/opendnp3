  Configuration of maximum event counts per event type.

  The underlying implementation uses a *preallocated* heap buffer to store events
  until they are transmitted to the master. The size of this buffer is proportional
  to the TotalEvents() method, i.e. the sum of the maximum events for each type.

  Implementations should configure the buffers to store a reasonable number events
  given the polling frequency and memory restrictions of the target platform.
