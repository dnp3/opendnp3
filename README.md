Overview
========

Opendnp3 is a portable, scalable, and rigorously tested implementation 
of the DNP3 (www.dnp.org) protocol stack written in C++11. The library 
can handle the largest front end processor loads, but can also be
ported to run on various microcontrollers.

Langauge bindings are available. Consult the documentation.
